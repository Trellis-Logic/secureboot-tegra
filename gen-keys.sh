## Generating the RSA Key Pair
#
# Secureboot requires an RSA key-pair whose length is 2048 bits (RSA 2K) or 3072â€‘bits (RSA 3K).
#
# The key file is used to burn fuse and sign boot files for Jetson devices.
# The security of your device depends on how securely you keep the key file.
#
# To ensure the security of the key file, restrict access permission to
# a minimum number of personnel.

# KEK keys are used for other security applications
# For instance, KEK2 can be used for LUKS disk encryption
#
#echo "Generating KEK0 (Key Encryption Key)"

 openssl rand -rand /dev/urandom -hex 16 > kek2_hex_file

# KEK256 option uses 256 bits but is stored in KEK0 and KEK1
# For the strongest encryption, we will opt for the KEK256 option

## Preparing the SBK Key
#
# If you want to encrypt Bootloader (and TOS), you must prepare the SBK fuse bits.
#
# Note:
#      You may only use the SBK key with the PKC key. The encryption mode
#      that uses these two keys together is called SBKPKC.
#
# The SBK key consists of four 32-bit words stored in a file in big-endian
# hexadecimal format. Here is an example of an SBK key file:
#
#   0x12345678 0x9abcdef0 0xfedcba98 0x76543210
echo "Generating SBK (Secure Boot Key)"
raw_hex=$(openssl rand -rand /dev/urandom -hex 16)
echo "0x${raw_hex:0:8} 0x${raw_hex:8:8} 0x${raw_hex:16:8} 0x${raw_hex:(-8)}" > sbk_hex_file

# If you want to encrypt kernel image (the kernel, kernel-dtb, initrd,
# and extlinux.conf files), you must prepare the user key. You need the
# user key as well as the SBK key and the PKC key.
echo "Generating user_key"
raw_hex=$(openssl rand -rand /dev/urandom -hex 16)
echo "0x${raw_hex:0:8} 0x${raw_hex:8:8} 0x${raw_hex:16:8} 0x${raw_hex:(-8)}" > user_key_hex_file
